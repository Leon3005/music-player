# LW Radio

## Description

LW Radio is a full-stack React application that allows users to listen to songs with a control panel to play, pause, skip forwards, and skip backwards. It also allows users to request songs by using the 'Request a song' button in the library. This sends a POST request to another deployed Heroku server.
